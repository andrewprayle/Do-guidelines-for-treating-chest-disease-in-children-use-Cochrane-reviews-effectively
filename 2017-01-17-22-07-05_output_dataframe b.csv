G0026,18,0,B3b In a child with suspected croup  oral dexamethasone is cheaper and as efficacious as budesonide. Until more evidence becomes available  oral dexamethasone should therefore be used in preference to nebulised budesonide except in those children who are vomiting or unable to tolerate oral.,1,1,RCPCH,2002,Ventilation in peri-anaesthetic/critical care,N,CD001955_V1_1999,1999,1999,Dexamethasone and budesonide are effective in relieving the symptoms of croup as early as 6 hours after treatment.
