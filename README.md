This is the repository for the data and source code for the study.  Running the file "source_code.r" in R will generate all the analyses shown in the paper.  Additionally, opening the "interactive_figure.html" in a modern browser will start the interactive figure.  

For those unfamiliar with GitHub, we suggest downloading the zip file, which will download all of the files.
